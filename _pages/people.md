# Keith Butler

Keith is Associate Professor in Computational Materials Chemistry. Previously he worked as a staff
scientist at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, as a post-doctoral resaercher in the
groups of Aron Walsh and John Harding, flipping cheestakes in 99 Miles to Philly and
the man behind the burger vending machine in Dublin's famous Ilac Centre. 

Keith serves as an associate editor of npj Computational Materials and on the editorial
board of Machine Learning Science and Technology. Keith is an active developer
 of several open source materials design packages [SMACT](https://smact.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html), [SuperResTomo](https://superres-tomo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html), [MacroDensity](https://github.com/WMD-group/MacroDensity) and a strong advocate of open science.

# Matthew Walker

Matthew is a PhD student in the group at UCL. His project aims to use graph neural networks to predict optical and electronic properties of semiconductors from chemical composition. During his master's in materials modelling (also at UCL) he studied sustainable thermoelectric materials in David Scanlon's group, before a brief stint in the corporate world confirmed his suspicions of its cold cynicism and his desire to return to the academic world.
When he isn't stuck behind a computer, he likes cooking, attempting a spectrum of exercise modalities, and learning new languages (currently Italian and Kotlin). [Matthew's webpage](https://mattheww98.github.io/)

# Mueen Taj

Mueen is a PhD student in the group at UCL. His project is based on developing machine learning approaches to enhance the analysis of neutron spectroscopy experiments, bridging the accuracy of density functional theory with the scalability of molecular dynamics for studying complex materials. Prior to his PhD, he studied materials chemistry at the University of Bradford and briefly ventured into the banking sector, before realising his passion for academic research leading to his big move to London. Outside of his work, Mueen is an avid gamer with a growing interest in metroidvania games, with Hollow Knight being a personal favourite.
