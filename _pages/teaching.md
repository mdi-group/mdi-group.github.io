MDIG is alwyas looking for ways to spread information and skills. Here are a collection 
of various teaching resources that we have either created or contributed to.

## Easter School 2025: Chemical and Materials Machine Learning School (CaMMLS) 

Sponsored by AIChemy Hub and PSDI we re-ran the ML school from 2025, this time expanded to a full week with extra sessions on generative models and unsupervised learning. The details of the school can be [found here](https://camml.ac.uk/). An eBook of the course contents is [also available](https://workshop.camml.ac.uk/intro.html). 

## Autumn School in Machine Learning for Atomistic Simulation 2023

With colleagues from Warwick, Imperial, STFC and Southampton we are running a school to train atomistic simulation
researchers in using the latest machine learning methods for their research. More details on the contents, 
pre-requisites and timetables can be found [on the school webpage.](https://www.psdi.ac.uk/event/machine-learning-autumn-school-2023/) 

## Intro to Data Analysis and Machine Learning for Engineers eBook

This is an eBook associated with the Data Analysis and Machine Learning section of the EMS506U course taught
to second year engineers at QMUL. The lectures are intended as a brief introduction to the principles and tools
 required for modern data analysis. We will work through from inspecting and cleaning data, to building simple 
models to explore relationships between variables, to building some modern neural networks for analysing images
 and sequences.
